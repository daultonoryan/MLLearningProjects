    &quot;## Project: Titanic Survival Exploration\n&quot;, 
    &quot;\n&quot;, 
    &quot;In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. In this introductory project, we will explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. To complete this project, you will need to implement several conditional predictions and answer the questions below. Your project submission will be evaluated based on the completion of the code and your responses to the questions.\n&quot;, 
    &quot;&gt; **Tip:** Quoted sections like this will provide helpful instructions on how to navigate and use an iPython notebook. &quot;

    &quot;# Getting Started\n&quot;, 
    &quot;To begin working with the RMS Titanic passenger data, we'll first need to `import` the functionality we need, and load our data into a `pandas` DataFrame.  \n&quot;, 
    &quot;Run the code cell below to load our data and display the first few entries (passengers) for examination using the `.head()` function.\n&quot;, 
    &quot;&gt; **Tip:** You can run a code cell by clicking on the cell and using the keyboard shortcut **Shift + Enter** or **Shift + Return**. Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the **Play** button in the hotbar after selecting it. Markdown cells (text cells like this one) can be edited by double-clicking, and saved using these same shortcuts. [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) allows you to write easy-to-read plain text that can be converted to HTML.&quot;

    &quot;From a sample of the RMS Titanic data, we can see the various features present for each passenger on the ship:\n&quot;, 
    &quot;- **Survived**: Outcome of survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)\n&quot;, 
    &quot;- **Pclass**: Socio-economic class (1 = Upper class; 2 = Middle class; 3 = Lower class)\n&quot;, 
    &quot;- **Name**: Name of passenger\n&quot;, 
    &quot;- **Sex**: Sex of the passenger\n&quot;, 
    &quot;- **Age**: Age of the passenger (Some entries contain `NaN`)\n&quot;, 
    &quot;- **SibSp**: Number of siblings and spouses of the passenger aboard\n&quot;, 
    &quot;- **Parch**: Number of parents and children of the passenger aboard\n&quot;, 
    &quot;- **Ticket**: Ticket number of the passenger\n&quot;, 
    &quot;- **Fare**: Fare paid by the passenger\n&quot;, 
    &quot;- **Cabin** Cabin number of the passenger (Some entries contain `NaN`)\n&quot;, 
    &quot;- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation of the passenger (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)\n&quot;, 
    &quot;\n&quot;, 
    &quot;Since we're interested in the outcome of survival for each passenger or crew member, we can remove the **Survived** feature from this dataset and store it as its own separate variable `outcomes`. We will use these outcomes as our prediction targets.  \n&quot;,

    &quot;# Conclusion\n&quot;, 
    &quot;\n&quot;, 
    &quot;After several iterations of exploring and conditioning on the data, you have built a useful algorithm for predicting the survival of each passenger aboard the RMS Titanic. The technique applied in this project is a manual implementation of a simple machine learning model, the *decision tree*. A decision tree splits a set of data into smaller and smaller groups (called *nodes*), by one feature at a time. Each time a subset of the data is split, our predictions become more accurate if each of the resulting subgroups are more homogeneous (contain similar labels) than before. The advantage of having a computer do things for us is that it will be more exhaustive and more precise than our manual exploration above. [This link](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) provides another introduction into machine learning using a decision tree.\n&quot;, 
    &quot;\n&quot;, 
    &quot;A decision tree is just one of many models that come from *supervised learning*. In supervised learning, we attempt to use features of the data to predict or model things with objective outcome labels. That is to say, each of our data points has a known outcome value, such as a categorical, discrete label like `'Survived'`, or a numerical, continuous value like predicting the price of a house.\n&quot;, 
    &quot;\n&quot;, 
    &quot;### Question 5\n&quot;, 
    &quot;*Think of a real-world scenario where supervised learning could be applied. What would be the outcome variable that you are trying to predict? Name two features about the data used in this scenario that might be helpful for making the predictions.*  &quot;

    &quot;I have a love hate realtionship with YOLO so I would like to talk about determining animal types. This is a classification problem because you are looking at leables either labels \n&quot;, 
    &quot;for each individual animal or Boolean labels for many different types of animals. In this \n&quot;, 
    &quot;case some features that might be good could be leg number and color.&quot;
